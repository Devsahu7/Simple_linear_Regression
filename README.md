# 📈 Simple Linear Regression (Machine Learning Project)

This project demonstrates the implementation of **Simple Linear Regression** using Python to predict one variable based on another.

The model is trained using a dataset containing Height and Weight values.

## 📌 Project Overview

Simple Linear Regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm used to model the relationship between two continuous variables.

In this project:
- 📊 Height is the independent variable (X)
- ⚖️ Weight is the dependent variable (Y)
- 📈 A regression line is fitted to predict weight based on height
